# opensim-web-login
A Functioning Web Login Implementation for OpenSim

Note from the Author
> It is well documented, and made so you can make a website be able to login with a OpenSim Account, requires Database Access.There are regularly run security checks, but use at your own risk....don't bother suing or anything if something goes wrong, I have better lawyers
